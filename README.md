Ateneo de Naga University has annually conducted an Orientation Seminar (ORSEM) which
aims to introduce freshmen and transferees to various university-related information. However,
back in 2020, what used to be an exciting opportunity to meet new people in a new environment
and know more about the university was compacted into a single screen. Therefore, taking into
consideration the goals of ORSEM, it is clear that its current set up can be further improved.
Alternate reality games (ARGs) are a type of game that takes place in the real world but uses the
internet and other media to blend fiction and reality together. And with the uniqueness of the
approach that ARG incorporates, it has proven itself to yield benefits. ARG is able to draw high
levels of engagement and retention of information, encourages collaboration and the development of a
learning community, and provides an environment where failure does not carry heavy consequences.
The study then aimed to create an alternate reality game and use its inherent benefits such as
increased engagement and immersion, increased information retention, an environment of safe failure,
and encouragement to collaboration and cooperation to serve as an improvement to the annual
OrSem that of Ateneo de Naga University. Through a quasi-experimental approach utilizing a
paired-sample t-test a statistically quantitative significant e↵ect was seen and a qualitative positive
e↵ect was inferred from the respondents after subjecting the respondents to the ARG. The study
then concludes that there is a positive e↵ect and a benefit in using an ARG on the Orientation
Seminar of Ateneo de Naga University.
